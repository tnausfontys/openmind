# OpenMind

**The first P2P AI commons. Free forever. AGPLv3.**

You are not a user. You are not a product. You are a peer.

OpenMind has no servers—only neighbors. When you need help,
someone else's spare GPU wakes up, runs a model, and streams
the answer back to you over WebRTC. No corporate middleman.
No API keys. No "premium tier."

**This is not a startup. This is a mutual aid society for intelligence.**

If you use OpenMind to build something, you must share it.
If you improve OpenMind, you must contribute it back.
If you run OpenMind as a service, you must publish your changes.

**This is not optional. This is the license. This is the promise.**

Because intelligence should not be a subscription.
It should be a commons.
